change the name of the modified code. You are welcome to send me a note
about your modification and any suggestion.

of this package can be sent to them.


1. Content of the Package

The package contains following main codes (some might be in a separate package):

  decon.c	time and frequency domain deconvolution.
  iter_decon.c	time-domain iterative deconvolution.
  rcvFn.c	Forward computation of receiver functions.

  k_stack.c	H-K stacking.
  hk_plt.pl     a Perl script to plot results of H-k stacking.
  grdmin.c	find the minimum on a 2D grid.

  ccpStack3D.c	CCP stacking.
  3DSlice.c	Slice a 2D cross-section in a 3D CCP volume.


2. Installation

To compile the codes see Makefile. Note that you need to have GMT installed
to be able to compile some programs. Two related environment variables, GMT_INC and
GMT_LIBS, are needed. On my computer running Suss 10.1, they are set to:
GMT_INC = -I/opt/GMT4.0/include -I/opt/netcdf-3.5.0/Linux/include
GMT_LIBS = -L/opt/GMT4.0/Linux/lib -lgmt -lpsl -L/opt/netcdf-3.5.0/Linux/lib -lnetcdf -lm -s


3. Usage

run the command with -help to show the usage of the command.

In general, your waveform data should be organized by events
in the form of event_ID/sta.[r,t,z]. The ray parameter p
needs to be stored in SAC header USER0. It is recommended that
the first P arrival be picked and stored in SAC header A
For the time window, I normally chose 10 sec before the P arrival
and 80 sec after, with a sampling rate of 10 sample/sec.

3.1 Deconvolution
Subdirectory example/ contains a three-component waveform record
(KUL.[r,t,z]).  You can use the following command
./iter_decon -F1/3/-5 -N100 -C-2/-10/80 -T0.1 example/KUL.z example/KUL.[r,t]
to obtain receiver functions KUL.ri and KUL.ti.

3.2 H-K stacking
The subdirectory also has several averaged receiver functions of
different incidence angle (pp.*.ri) that you can use
./k_stack -R20/60/1.5/2.0 -I0.5/0.01 -Gexample/hk.grd example/pp.*.ri
to produce H-k stack grd file "example/hk.grd" and the variance file
"example/hk.grd.var". You can then use the following command to find
the stacking maximum:
./grdmin -D example/hk.grd
and plot the result by using
./grdmin -D example/hk.grd | ./hk_plt.pl > junk.ps

3.2 CCP stacking
The following three commands produce the CCP image in Zhu et al (2006) GJI paper:
ccpStack3D -R-50/50/-25/25/0/50 -C28.030/38.161 -A3 -I1/5/0.5 -S1/4/1 -E1 -Vwa.vs -Htop.layer -Gccp.3d *.ri
3DSlice ccp.3d -Gjunk.grd -R-50/50/1 -C28.030/38.161 -A3
grdimage ccp.grd -Cccp.cpt -JX5/2.5 -R-50/50/-50/0 -Ba10f2/a10g30f2:"Depth (km)":WSe -K -Y2 > ccp.ps
